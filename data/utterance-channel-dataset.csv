"Hello I'm new here and stuck on something - any insight appreciated. I can see via bar charts that when X falls within upper and lower quartiles I get significant change in the avg value of y (which is a % representing risk). I have around 10 such features I am evaluating. Using Random Forest Regressor (sklearn), I feed continuous X data (better result) and also try categorising X by quartile bucket (worse result). Am I using the right algo for for this scenario please? Can random forest understand that my features are predictive only when they have extreme values (I guess this is a non linear relationship)",general-questions,74
"Hello. I’m new here and wanted to ask a question specifically about feature engineering. When I google this topic, articles like to highlight that it is an extremely important part of machine learning (I would agree with that) but then they go on to focus on topics like data cleaning (dealing with missing data) extracting information (from names or street addresses), adding data (like if you have a location and time, you could add the weather) or removing useless data that can muddy the model. Certainly all important topics but there is one area I’m interested in that does not seem to be discussed. In one of the Kaggle learn sections they mention how one of the practice competitions is the loan defaults data set. The competition is designed to be setup as a black box where we are not meant to have an intimate knowledge of the data to build new features. They mention that someone figured out that, out of the hundreds of features, if you subtract 1 specific one from another, you created a new feature with high predictability. But they never discuss HOW it was found that those feature combinations had the dependency. So, TL;DR if you have a data set with hundreds or more columns, where you do not have an intuitive knowledge of the information, how can you go about finding potentially impactful combinations. I’m sure you could brute force it but if the data set was large enough, this would become computationally expensive right? Is there a statistical method for determining this?",general-questions,75

"Hey everyone, I just finished the first chunk of this project: https://github.com/CharlesAverill/satyrn, an alternative to jupyter notebooks that allows you to run cells in parallel. It’s especially useful in the data science field as you can process unrelated data in parallel, often greatly speeding up total runtime. However there’s no UI yet, it’s completely command-line-based. If anyone wants to join the project and help build the frontend, I would greatly appreciate it. Thank you!",member-generated-content,151
"Hey everyone! A bunch of us got fed up with how rigid the PyTorch dataloader can be at times. We ended up building some scaffolding around the DataLoader class, to enable things like dynamic labels (we use a JSON file to label images, rather than subfolders in a dataset), loading a subset of a dataset, being able to pre-process an image using a custom function (do we want to generate a bunch of crops per source image before loading?) and so on. We're calling it BetterLoader, and I would love to hear what you all think and whether you think a project like this would be helpful. We're finding it useful within our deep learning workflows, and would appreciate a star if you think it would be too  https://github.com/binitai/betterloader(edited)",member-generated-content,152

"Great resume Papa! I love that you started with a personal statement and prominently showcase your skills. Here are a few things I would recommend changing: 1. I assume your name and contact info is normally appended and you just redacted that for this post. If not, I would definitely add it  2. It's not clear to me if you have just a bachelors or a masters as well based on the two GPAs listed. If you have a masters, I would list that as a separate degree from the same school. Right now, its very easy to miss. 3. You don't need to list your 3.1 GPA if you don't want to 4. Your personal statement looks more like a list of projects that a statement about yourself. I would recommend you create a list of projects and list those if you have them. I would write something personal for your personal statement along the lines of what you care about and what you're excited by. 5. If you create a list of projects, make sure you explain the projects you completed. Faraz's resume below has some good examples of how to list projects. 6. A lot of what you list in your personal statement can be put in your skills section, things like data visualization, data cleaning, automation, data analysis can all be skills you put in your skills section. 7. I have a hard time understanding your certifications and extra courses section. It could use further clarification to show what is a certification, what is an extra course, and what it means that you took extra courses. Maybe touch on that in your personal statement about going above and beyond in your education. I think these should be some good tips for now. Feel free to respost your resume with edits and we'll take a second pass at it",Resume Review,283

"Thanks for sharing your resume Faraz. It looks excellent. You have great formatting, I love that you bolded the key terms and figures, and I like that you led with technical skills. Improving your resume required getting a little more creative, but here are my ideas: 1. You may benefit from a personal statement. Personal statements are an opportunity to bring some humanity and a face to your resume, which is otherwise fairly flat. Just like product ads don't just list the features, but try and connect to the customer, you might benefit from a personal statement that resonates with a potential employer. Examples might be: you always go the extra mile to exceed client expectations, you love storytelling and data is a way you love to make your stories better, or youre entrepreneurial and you try new solutions. 2. Another way to bring a personal touch is to add your hobbies. Most employers want to work with people they'll also like being around, and I'm sure you're a great person to be around. If you're afraid that sharing your hobbies might be too foreign or unfamiliar to your employer, I have very unique hobbies and interests on my resume, like Talmud. Usually it's just a conversation starter. 3. You have work experience but you don't have big brand names on your resume to give you credibility (besides for your university). Since you've done a lot of projects for a lot of different people, you may benefit from a section that lists references from people you've worked for, and even reviews from those people if you have them. If you have one or two glowing reviews on your resume, itd be hard for anyone to discount that. And definitely give a brief background of the people you're providing as references if you do. 4. You have a great skills section, but you could always add more. Often the goal is hit on an employer search term, so don't be bashful about adding in additional terms that you think your employer may be searching for. Like data cleaning for example",Resume Review,298
